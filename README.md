 # CS 3503 Assignment 2- Advanced Data Representation
  ## Author
 Augustas Jasinskas
  ## Description
 My implementation of Owl Techâ€™s Advanced Data Representation Utility.
  ## Build Instructions
  
  gcc-o convert convert.c main.c ./convert

 
  ## Test Results
  51/51 Tests Passed.
 
  ## Notes
  I decided to implement a couple of helper functions in convert.c because of some necessary but repeated lines of code, to allow for better readability and prevent mistakes. Understanding the differences between the 3 forms of negative number representation and how they differ from one another was a challenge for me which made me take a good bit of time on those functions.
